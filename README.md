# Bug-Fixes

A project for Solution Challenge 2025 organised by Google Develpoer Group, India.

Problem Statement :
Library & Tool for analysis & synthesis of Indian Classical Music

This uses a neural & symbolic processing to analyze and synthesize Indian Classical music. Certain parts are done in traditional speech processing for recognition and analysis of audio signals. Some of them are done using symbolic processing for generating & synthesizing notes. Finally some neural (transformer/latent diffusion based models) for parsing and synthesizing audio.

Objective:
This use case addresses the problem of analysis and synthesis of Indian Classical Music. The AI-based solution uses a combination of neural and symbolic processing to analyze and synthesize Indian Classical music. Certain parts are done in traditional speech processing for recognition and analysis of audio signals. Some of them are done using symbolic processing for generating & synthesizing notes. Finally some neural (transformer/latent diffusion based models) for parsing and synthesizing audio.
